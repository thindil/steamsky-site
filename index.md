Steam Sky is an open source roguelike with a steampunk setting. You are a
commander of a flying ship, as leader you will be traveling across floating
bases, engaging in combat, trading goods etc. The game is more strategy
based than tactical like most of roguelikes. There is no mandatory ending
to this game, you may freely play until your character die. The game is
currently in a development, but is in a playable state. Steam Sky is available
on Linux and Windows 64 bit platforms.

## Features
- Buy cheaply, sell expensive: find best trade routes between sky bases.

    Each base type sell other items. Some bases even only buy items. Prices of
    items in bases depends on bases types. For example, it is good idea to buy
    food in agricultural bases and sell it to industrial bases.

- Do randomly generated missions to gain money and reputation at sky bases.

    Patrol selected map areas, explore new areas, deliver items to bases, etc.
    Some missions may require some free cargo space, others may depends on
    installed ship modules.

- Manage your ship's crew: give them orders, hire new ones or dismiss old
  members.

    Your crew and your character must eat and drink. Wounded, hungry or tired
    crew members works slower. As crew members spend some time on given order
    he or she will gain experience in selected skill which allow works faster
    or more precise.

- Manage your ship: upgrade installed modules, install new ones, or repair
  damaged ones.

    Progress in game depends on installed ship modules. With stronger modules,
    you have bigger chance to meet stronger enemies. You must balance your
    progress between gaining experience by crew members and installing new,
    better ship modules. Or some day, you meet too strong enemy for you.

- Craft items: from tools through repair materials to food.

    At the start your character know only few basic crafting recipes. New
    recipes may be bought from bases or discovered by deconstructing items.
    Better manufacturer can craft more items from this same amount of
    materials.

- Fight with enemy ships in tactical combat.

    Give orders to your crew at the beginning of each combat round and watch
    the result when turn passed. Change your ship speed, position of your ship
    in the combat or give your gunners orders to attack selected part of the
    enemy ship. Take down enemies armor to board they ships for melee combat
    for better loot. If enemy is too strong for you, you can try escape from
    the combat too.

- Your game, your way: change the game to your own style.

    Almost everything in the game can be changed, added or removed via data
    files, which are plain XML files. Add new "races" (factions), change
    existing ships (their statistics, crew or cargo) or remove "professions"
    (careers). Items and crafting recipes can be changed too. Even interface
    can be tweaked to your needs.
