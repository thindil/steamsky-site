-- news: <p>In the stable version of the game, just one bug was appeared. Caught, fixed and this mean, that in less than 24 hours since this post, new stable version will be available for download.</p><p>In the development version this week was mostly dedicated to learn how to count: one, two, three, many. Better than earlier, was: one, many :)</p><ul><li>Counting time and fuel needed to reach destination point on map now consider time and fuel needed for resting during fly either. Of course it is still estimated calculations - it don't add possible random events or combats on the way to target.</li><li>Much better count for max amount of items to sell or buy during trade with bases or traders ships. This was bit harder to count. Items prices depends not only on their amount, but also from crew member who trade skill and player reputation with that trader or base. Thus if you sell more you can get better price and when you buy more, you can get bigger discount. Additionally, money are used as fuel too, have own weight either. At the end, current calculations for max amount items finally started to counting it too. New code which doing it, is even longer than this explanation :)</li><li>Food and drinks have influence on morale too. Better food and drinks can boost morale, when raw food (eaten only when no other food is available) reduce morale.</li><li>Destroying friendly ship now have bigger chance to lose reputation with it home base than earlier.</li><li>Gaining reputation in sky bases was speed up again. And probably last time :) Now it is almost 20 times faster than first version. But still take some time to maximize reputation in bases.</li><li>Few new items and crafting recipes for them arrived too.</li></ul>

-- news: <p>From the stable version: as usual, just after release, the future stable version of the game will be more stable - 2 bugs less this time :)</p><p>Development front: still tweaking factions and some changes in the world generation:</p><ul><li>Drones got special ability: sentient ships. Pilot and engineer is optional for this faction to fly ship but very experienced crew members can give a lot more benefits that without. Ships of this faction have some basic "skills" needed to fly, generally, bigger ship = better "skills".</li><li>Inquisition got special ability "fanaticism": they morale go up faster than other factions and go down much slower than others. And because morale have impact on skills and loyality of crew members, this may lead to bit more interesting game-play than earlier.</li><li>Raised start level of Strength of Undead player and crew members by cost of lowering other stats. Now this faction is good in melee combat, especially dangerous for lightly armored enemies.</li><li>Players often complained that they had problems with finding other bases, especially at beginning of the game. Old world "generation" code was just grab bases and throw around map. New is bit more advanced (but still simpler than combat code, heh). It now grouping bases of this same faction in territories. It is much easier now to find bases, unless player starts in very unlucky position, or look below.</li><li>Independents and Pirates got special faction flag "loner": they bases are still randomly located on the map or even sometimes, between bases of other factions. Thus if someone want to bring old world generation, he/she just need to add this flag to other factions either.</li><li>Finally finished adding ships to the game. At least until there will not arrive another faction. Now I'm started adding weapons and crafting recipes for them, lets finally will be some use from my type of damage system :)</li></ul><p>And, it is time for release new development version of the game. Why only I should have fun with so much bugs? :) In around 24 hours after this post, new development version will be released. And this mean another thing too: we are in the middle of way to 4.0 version :)</p>

-- news: <p>All known bugs in stable version was fixed which means: time for new stable release tomorrow (in around 24 hours after this post). We will see how many bugs will be found this time.</p><p>In development version this week was mostly upgrades to the game factions (races).</p><ul><li>Undead faction members was definitely too weak (especially player when selected them as the starting faction). They gained two things: natural armor which allow them to reduce damage taken in melee combat. Second thing is special toxic attack when they attack unarmed and target is not immune to diseases (most other factions members). In that situation, Undead can do a lots more damage. There still is some work to balance this faction but I should finish it in next week.</li><li>Drones got this same special thing: natural armor which reduce damage in melee combat.</li></ul><p>All special "abilities" of factions are represented as flags thus they are very easy to add/remove to others or new factions, especially that almost all game data are in XML files.</p>Additionally, development version got as usual, few bug fixes, few new bugs and few new NPC ships.</p><p>During tests I was once bit funny situation: during combat my Undead ship against Inquisition, I was sent my whole crew as boarding party on enemy ship. When we arrived, I noticed that there is only one enemy (should be 4). By the moment I was thinking that something is wrong with game data, but then I reminded myself: rest of enemy crew was set AI to boarding either. So, when I boarded them, they are boarded my own empty ship :) This ended in two different melee combats (first on enemy ship then back on my own).</p>

-- news: <p>After few weeks of postpone for later, it is, finally, shiny, etc, etc just one ugly 4 mins video of new UI of the game: <a href="https://vimeo.com/322418460">https://vimeo.com/322418460</a> created by very inexperienced in making videos person, me :)</p><p>And back to the more interesting things - changes in game :)</p><p>First of all: release new stable version worked perfect as trap for new bugs - few appeared almost instantaneous. Well, at least there will be some reason to release another stable version :)</p><p>In development version I was probably finished fun with UI for this released. Unless I will get some crazy ideas again :) As wrote above, effect of this work is visible on the video.</p></p>Probably much more important information: completely redesigned how battering rams works in ship's combat. Earlier this weapon was very unhandy and weak, now it is changed:</p><ul><li>Good news: now damage from battering ram depends not only on it, but on speed and the mass of the ship. Thus first attack in combat, when both ships going closer to self may be very powerful. With good hit probably big ship should destroy small one in one hit.</li><li>Bad news: battering rams now attack only every 2 rounds in combat - this weakening was needed to not made battering ram too powerful. Because there is one more thing</li><li>Probably good news again: battering ram now works like something between normal guns and harpoon guns. It made damage plus when it hit unarmored target, it stopping it, allowing to send to other ship boarding party. This should be really good change especially for players who choice Undead faction (their starting ships are equipped only in battering rams).</li></ul><p>Thus now we have 3 types of weapon in ship's combat: pure damage (guns), control (harpoon guns) and hybrid (battering rams). This should made ship's combat little more interesting.</p><p>And as usual, added few new NPC ship prototypes to the game and replaced some old bugs by new :)</p>
