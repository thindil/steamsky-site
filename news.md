-- news: <p>After few weeks of postpone for later, it is, finally, shiny, etc, etc just one ugly 4 mins video of new UI of the game: <a href="https://vimeo.com/322418460">https://vimeo.com/322418460</a> created by very inexperienced in making videos person, me :)</p><p>And back to the more interesting things - changes in game :)</p><p>First of all: release new stable version worked perfect as trap for new bugs - few appeared almost instantaneous. Well, at least there will be some reason to release another stable version :)</p><p>In development version I was probably finished fun with UI for this released. Unless I will get some crazy ideas again :) As wrote above, effect of this work is visible on the video.</p></p>Probably much more important information: completely redesigned how battering rams works in ship's combat. Earlier this weapon was very unhandy and weak, now it is changed:</p><ul><li>Good news: now damage from battering ram depends not only on it, but on speed and the mass of the ship. Thus first attack in combat, when both ships going closer to self may be very powerful. With good hit probably big ship should destroy small one in one hit.</li><li>Bad news: battering rams now attack only every 2 rounds in combat - this weakening was needed to not made battering ram too powerful. Because there is one more chance</li><li>Probably good news again: battering ram now works like something between normal guns and harpoon guns. It made damage plus when it hit unarmored target, it stopping it, allowing to send to other ship boarding party. This should be really good change especially for players who choice Undead faction (their starting ships are equipped only in battering rams).</li></ul><p>Thus now we have 3 types of weapon in ship's combat: pure damage (guns), control (harpoon guns) and hybrid (battering rams). This should made ship's combat little more interesting.</p><p>And as usual, added few new NPC ship prototypes to the game and replaced some old bugs by new :)</p>
